# Next actions (single-page)

## Today (2×60min deep work)

### Block A (60m): Lock v1 spec + backlog
- [ ] Decide tie-break rule (document + implement)
- [ ] Decide challenge window semantics (document)
- [ ] Create a short backlog list (5–10 items) with acceptance criteria

### Block B (60m): Ship one concrete improvement
Pick one:
- [ ] Implement tie-break + add unit test/fixture
- [ ] Generate `scoreboard.md` output from evaluation JSON
- [ ] Make `release` idempotent and clearly logged

## Tomorrow (first task — copy/paste)
Open `NEXT.md` and do **one** of the “Block B” items end-to-end, including docs updates and a quick rerun of `demo.sh` to confirm outputs.
